# Cloud Climber :cloud:

### This is a 2D platformer that we created in Unity with 2021.3.23.f1. 

## Instructions:
 
 * You can control your character with ```AD``` or the ```Left and Right arrow keys``` and use the Space bar to jump.
 * You want to avoid the thunder clouds and try not to fall off the bottom of the screen.
 
 #### You can access our game via this [link](https://teylorchapman.itch.io/cloud-climber) or with our QR code ![This is alt text.](/downloads/qr-code.png)
